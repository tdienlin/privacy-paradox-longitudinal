# Brief history of privacy paradox

- Privacy concerns **inconsistent with** SNS behavior `r Cite(my_bib, "Acquisti.2003")`

--

- Description of SNS privacy behavior as **paradoxical** `r Cite(my_bib, "Barnes.2006")`

--

- Afterward, explicit studies on privacy paradox

   - Some show **no relation** between privacy concerns and information sharing  `r Cite(my_bib, "Taddicken.2014")`
   
   - Some show **significant relation** between privacy concerns and information sharing `r Cite(my_bib, "Dienlin.2016a")`

--

- Meta-Analysis: Privacy concerns and information sharing on SNSs are **significantly related, _r_ = -.13** `r Cite(my_bib, "Baruh.2017")`

---

# Aims of current study

- **Longitudinal analysis** of privacy concerns and information sharing

--

- Separation of **between and within-person** variance

--

    - General differences between people?
    
--

    - Short term relations within a person?
    
--

    - Long term relations within a person?

--

- Longitudinal analysis of **privacy attitudes**

# Method

# Procedure & participants

- Paper-pencil questionnaire 

    - **3 waves**: May 2014, November 2014, May 2015

- **Representative sample** of the German population

    - _N_ = 1,419

    - Age = 54 years, _SD_ = 15 years

    - Female = 49%

# Measures

.smaller[
**Privacy concerns** (6 items; CFI = .97, RMSEA = .06, $\omega$ = .90)

- “Are you concerned that institutions or secret services could collect and analyze the data that you are disclosing in the Internet?”
- “Are you concerned about people you do not know obtaining personal information about you from your online activities?”

**Attitudes information sharing** (10 items; CFI = .96, RMSEA = .11, $\omega$ = .94)

- „Do you think that it is sensible to share the following pieces of information online?”
- 1. Second name, 2. First name, 3. Residence (town), 4. Street + no., 5. Financial information, 6. Medical information, 7. e-mail address, 8. Phone number, 9. Job, 10. Education

**Information sharing** (10 items; CFI = .97, RMSEA = .10, $\omega$ = .95)

- How often do you share the following pieces of information online?
- 1. Second name, 2. First name, 3. Residence (town), 4. Street + no., 5. Financial information, 6. Medical information, 7. e-mail address, 8. Phone number, 9. Job, 10. Education

# Statistics

- Hypotheses tested with **one-tailed** approach, Research Questions with **two-tailed** approach (Holm-Bonferroni-corrected)

--

- Smallest effect size of interest `r Cite(my_bib, "Lakens.2014")`: $\beta$ = **.10**

--

- Alpha and beta-errors **balanced** `r Cite(my_bib, "Rouder.2016")`

--

   - $\alpha$ = `r alpha_balanced %>% round(3)`
   - $\beta$ = `r alpha_balanced %>% round(3)`
   - Power = `r (1 - alpha_balanced) * 100 %>% round(3)`%
   
--

- Data analysed with Random Intercept-Cross Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) `r Cite(my_bib, "Hamaker.2015")`

# Discussion

---

# Implications

- Important to conduct longitudinal studies to separate between- and within relations

--

- Between people

    - Concerns and sharing **related weakly**
    - Attitudes and sharing **related strongly**

--

- Within people

    - Concerns and sharing **related weakly**
    - Attitudes and sharing **related substantially**
    - **No long-term effects** for concerns and sharing

--

- Future research: Shorter invervals with actual observations of behavior

--

- Information sharing online **not paradoxical**

    - Instead of privacy paradox, rather **privacy orthodox**
