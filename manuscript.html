<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
<p>The privacy paradox states that people’s concerns about online
privacy are unrelated to their online sharing of personal information.
On the basis of a representative sample of the German population, which
includes 1403 respondents interviewed at three waves separated by 6
months, we investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal
perspective. Using a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts, we
differentiate between-person relations from within-person effects.
Results revealed that people who were more concerned about their online
privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information and
had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing
(between-person level). People who were more concerned than usual also
shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level). We
found no long-term effects of privacy concerns on information sharing or
attitudes 6 months later. The results provide further evidence against
the privacy paradox, but more research is needed to better understand
potential causal relations.</p>

<!-- # Introduction -->
<p>The privacy paradox states that the information disclosure of
Internet users is problematic: Although many people are concerned about
their privacy online, they still share plenty of personal information on
the web <span class="citation">(e.g., Acquisti and Grossklags,
2003)</span>. The privacy paradox is of considerable interest to
society—it is discussed in newspapers <span class="citation">(Frean,
2017)</span>, Wikipedia entries <span class="citation">(Wikipedia,
2018)</span>, designated websites <span class="citation">(New York
Public Radio, 2018)</span>, books <span class="citation">(Trepte and
Reinecke, 2011)</span>, and top-tier academic journals <span
class="citation">(Acquisti et al., 2015)</span>. If the privacy paradox
really exists, it should inspire worry: It would suggest that online
behavior is irrational and that people are revealing too much of their
personal information, which can cause various problems <span
class="citation">(e.g., Sevignani, 2016)</span>. Understanding why
people disclose information online and whether or not this is
paradoxical therefore represents an important challenge.</p>
<p>However, current research on the privacy paradox has one major
limitation. To the best of our knowledge, most empirical studies
conducted so far have investigated the privacy paradox from a
between-person perspective. By employing empirical tests of relations
between people (e.g., cross-sectional questionnaires analyzed with
multiple regression or Pearson correlations), studies have analyzed
whether people who are more concerned than <em>others</em> also share
less personal information than <em>others</em>. Although such a
perspective is interesting and represents a viable first step, it cannot
make informed claims regarding causality. The privacy paradox, however,
implies a causal perspective: Does a person, if <em>they</em> become
more concerned about online privacy, then also share less personal
information? This mismatch is problematic because although
between-person relations are, except for some special cases, a
<em>necessary</em> condition for causal within-person effects, they are
by no means a <em>sufficient</em> one. For example, it could be that the
between-person relation is determined by other third variables. Hence,
as the next step in investigating the privacy paradox and to better
understand the causal relation between privacy concerns and information
sharing, it is necessary to conduct studies with within-person
designs.</p>
<p>With this study we aim to answer four major questions. First, on a
between-person level, how are concerns about online privacy related to
the online sharing of personal information? Second, on a within-person
level, is information sharing lower than usual when concerns are higher
than usual? Third, what are the potential long-term effects? Are changes
in concerns related to changes in information sharing 6 months later
and/or vice versa? Fourth, what is the role of privacy attitudes, do
they mediate the relation between privacy concerns and information
sharing? To best answer and contextualize these questions, we first
provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of the privacy paradox, after
which we present the empirical results of a longitudinal panel study,
which is representative of the German population.</p>
<div id="a-brief-history-of-the-privacy-paradox" class="section level2">
<h2>A Brief History of the Privacy Paradox</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Acquisti and Grossklags (2003)</span> were
among the first to argue that the online disclosure of personal
information is paradoxical. “Experiments reveal that very few
individuals actually take any action to protect their personal
information, even when doing so involves limited costs” (p.1). Three
years later, <span class="citation">Barnes (2006)</span> discussed the
behavior of young people on SNSs, popularizing the term <em>privacy
paradox</em>. Barnes considered the following six aspects of online
behavior particularly paradoxical: (a) illusion of privacy, (b) high
quantity of information sharing, (c) attitude behavior discrepancy, (d)
lack of privacy concerns, (e) lack of privacy literacy, and (f)
fabrication of false information. <span class="citation">Norberg et al.
(2007)</span> were one of the first to empirically analyze the privacy
paradox explicitly. The study found a mismatch between concerns and
behavior, which is aligned with several other experimental studies
conducted at the time <span class="citation">(Beresford et al., 2012;
Hann et al., 2007; Huberman et al., 2005)</span>.</p>
<p>While there are various understandings and operationalizations of the
privacy paradox <span class="citation">(Kokolakis, 2017)</span>,
subsequent research focused on Barnes’s third tenet, the
attitude-behavior discrepancy. Whereas some studies reported that
privacy concerns were not significantly related to the disclosure of
personal information <span class="citation">(e.g., Gross and Acquisti,
2005; Taddicken, 2014; Tufekci, 2008)</span>, which lends credence to
the privacy paradox, a different set of studies showed significant
relations <span class="citation">(e.g., Dienlin and Trepte, 2015;
Heirman et al., 2013; Walrave et al., 2012)</span>, which refutes the
privacy paradox.</p>
<p>Notably, in a parallel line of research other studies have also
analyzed the relation between privacy concerns and information sharing.
However, the term privacy paradox was often not used explicitly.
Instead, studies have referred to the so-called <em>privacy
calculus</em>, which states that the sharing of personal information
online is affected by both the respective costs and the anticipated
benefits <span class="citation">(Culnan and Armstrong, 1999)</span>. By
now, several studies have found empirical support for the privacy
calculus in various online contexts <span class="citation">(e.g., Bol et
al., 2018; Dienlin and Metzger, 2016; Krasnova et al., 2010)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Baruh et al. (2017)</span> published the first
empirical meta-analysis on the relations between privacy concerns and
various forms of social media use (e.g., information sharing or SNS
usage). On the basis of 37 studies, <span class="citation">Baruh et al.
(2017)</span> found a small and significant statistical relation between
concerns about online privacy and online information sharing (<em>r</em>
= -.13, 95% CI [-.07, -.18]). Another more recent meta analysis by <span
class="citation">Yu et al. (2020)</span> also finds a significant
bivariate relation between privacy concerns and information sharing,
albeit smaller (<em>r</em> = -.06, 95% CI [-.01, -.12]). There also
exist several systematic literature reviews on the privacy paradox <span
class="citation">(Barth and Jong, 2017; Gerber et al., 2018; Kokolakis,
2017)</span>. <span class="citation">Kokolakis (2017)</span> come to the
conclusion that “the dichotomy between privacy attitude and behaviour
should not be considered a paradox anymore.” (p. 130) However, the
authors also note that the privacy paradox is a “complex phenomenon that
has not been fully explained yet”. <span class="citation">Barth and Jong
(2017)</span> are more skeptical, and argue that “attempts to
theoretically explain and practically solve the problem of the privacy
paradox are still scarce and we feel the subject deserves far more
research attention” (p. 1052).</p>
</div>
<div id="defining-privacy-concerns-and-information-sharing"
class="section level2">
<h2>Defining Privacy Concerns and Information Sharing</h2>
<p>Privacy is defined as the “[…] voluntary and temporary withdrawal of
a person from the general society through physical or psychological
means […]” <span class="citation">(Westin, 1967: 7)</span>. Privacy
captures aspects of both volitional <em>control</em> and social
<em>separateness</em> <span class="citation">(Bräunlich et al., 2020;
Marwick and boyd, 2014)</span>. People from all cultural backgrounds
require privacy to fulfill fundamental needs including personal care,
protected communication, intimacy, or sexuality <span
class="citation">(Altman, 1977; Westin, 1967)</span>. Being a universal
human right <span class="citation">(UN General Assembly, 1948, Art.
12)</span>, privacy is essential for safety, psychosocial flourishing,
and dignity. It is driven by both individual needs and interpersonal
negotiations thereof <span class="citation">(Trepte, 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Several dimensions of privacy have been proposed. For example, it is
possible to distinguish a vertical and a horizontal level <span
class="citation">(Masur, 2018)</span>. Whereas the vertical level
captures privacy from authorities, institutions, or companies,
horizontal privacy addresses privacy from peers, colleagues, or other
people. When it comes to concerns in general, interestingly they do not
seem to be established as a stand-alone theoretical concept in
psychology <span class="citation">(Colman, 2015)</span>. Concerns are
usually understood as an uneasy mix of “interest, uncertainty, and
apprehension” <span class="citation">(Merriam-Webster, 2018)</span>. As
a theoretical construct, privacy concerns can hence be categorized as an
affective motivational disposition. Taken together, concerns about
online privacy represent how much an individual is motivated to focus on
their control over a voluntary withdrawal from other people or societal
institutions on the Internet, accompanied by an uneasy feeling that
their privacy might be threatened.</p>
<p>The online sharing of personal information, on the other hand,
captures how much person-related information people share when they use
the Internet. Information sharing can be differentiated from
communication and self-disclosure. Communication is broad, because it
comprises all verbal and nonverbal information that is emitted <span
class="citation">(e.g., Watzlawick et al., 2011)</span>. Self-disclosure
is more narrow, because it focuses on deliberate revelations about the
true self to others, including aspects such as personal fears, values,
or plans <span class="citation">(e.g., Jourard, 1964)</span>.
Information sharing is even more specific, because it addresses only
person-related information, including information about their age, sex,
name, address, health, and finances.</p>
<p>In what follows we hence investigate the two concepts of (a) concerns
about online privacy and (b) online information sharing, aiming to
investigate how they relate conceptually. In doing so, we adopt and
focus on the perspective of individual people.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-relation-between-privacy-concerns-and-information-sharing"
class="section level2">
<h2>The Relation Between Privacy Concerns and Information Sharing</h2>
<p>Currently, there is a lack of studies that explicitly analyze how
behavior is affected by <em>concerns</em> in general. Fortunately,
however, we know much about the behavioral effects of related concepts
such as attitudes or fears, which all can affect behavior, sometimes
profoundly <span class="citation">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010; Rogers,
1983)</span>. Emotions, perhaps the concept most closely related to
concerns, have a particularly strong effect on behavior. By causing
fight, flight, or freeze reactions, they are a primordial trigger of
behavior and are considered to be an adaptive mechanism of evolved
species <span class="citation">(Dolan, 2002)</span>.</p>
<p>Also empirically, concerns have been shown to affect behavior <span
class="citation">(Hayes and Ross, 1987; Reel et al., 2007)</span>. For
example, people more concerned about the environment show more
environment-related behaviors <span class="citation">(Bamberg,
2003)</span>. Taken together, it is reasonable to expect that also
concerns about online privacy should somehow reflect in the online
sharing of personal information.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are some factors that likely diminish the
relation. Most prominently, there is the so-called <em>attitude behavior
gap</em> <span class="citation">(Fishbein and Ajzen, 2010)</span>, which
states that people sometimes act against their own attitudes. Evidently,
not everyone concerned about their physical health exercises regularly.
The explanation is simple: Other factors such as subjective norms and
perceived behavioral control also determine behavior <span
class="citation">(Ajzen, 1985)</span>, which automatically reduces the
impact of attitudes or concerns.</p>
<p>Specifically, two of the most influential factors that affect online
information sharing are (a) strong subjective norms <span
class="citation">(Heirman et al., 2013)</span> and (b) expected benefits
<span class="citation">(Krasnova et al., 2010)</span>. In other words,
users often prioritize social support, special offers, or improved
services, accepting that their privacy will be diminished. Sometimes,
privacy concerns do not relate to information sharing, because users
lack the skills, knowledge, or literacy to change their online behavior,
creating feelings of apathy or cynicism <span
class="citation">(Hargittai and Marwick, 2016; Hoffmann et al.,
2016)</span>. Likewise, personal information is also often shared by
others, a phenomenon described as “networked privacy” <span
class="citation">(Marwick and boyd, 2014)</span>, which further reduces
the power of individuals to determine how much personal information can
be found online. <span class="citation">Trepte et al. (2014)</span>
listed several factors that can additionally attenuate the relation:
lack of strength of concerns, absence of negative personal experiences,
or situational constraints due to social desirability. In conclusion,
also in the context of the privacy paradox it is <em>not</em> reasonable
to expect a <em>perfect</em> relation between attitudes and behaviors.
However, we should still expect to find a relation that is
<em>small</em> or <em>moderate</em>.</p>
<p>There are also some methodological explanations as to why some
studies did not detect statistically significant relations. Researchers
are always confronted with the so-called <em>Duhem-Quine problem</em>,
according to which it is impossible to test theories in isolation,
because empirical tests always rely on auxiliary assumptions <span
class="citation">(Dienes, 2008)</span>. In other words, if a
psychological experiment fails, we do not know whether the theory is
wrong or the questionnaire subpar. This tenet is particularly relevant
for the privacy paradox: Detecting statistical significance for small
effects—and, again, we should expect to find small or moderate
effects—is more challenging because it means that large samples are
necessary to guarantee sufficient statistical power.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Precisely, in order to
be capable of detecting a correlation between privacy concerns and
information sharing in 95% of all cases, which <span
class="citation">Baruh et al. (2017)</span> estimated to be <em>r</em> =
-.13, we need a sample of <em>N</em> = 762 people. The reality, however,
looks different: In their meta-analysis, <span class="citation">Baruh et
al. (2017)</span> reported a median sample size of <em>N</em> = 300,
which can explain why several studies did not find significant
effects.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we expect to find a small significant relation between
privacy concerns and information sharing, both on the between-person
level (Hypothesis 1) and the within-person level (Hypothesis 2).<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Hypothesis 1: People who are more concerned about their online
privacy than others will also be less likely to share personal
information online than others.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2: People who are more concerned about their online
privacy than they usually are will also share less personal information
online than they usually do.</p>
</div>
<div id="long-term-perspective" class="section level2">
<h2>Long-Term Perspective</h2>
<p>Although short-term effects are likely, it is still unclear whether
long-term effects exist as well. First, when analyzing potential
long-term effects, it is important to choose an interval that is both
plausible and relevant. It makes a large difference whether the effects
of alcohol consumption on driving performance are tested after say 1
minute, 1 hour, or 1 day. One factor that determines an interval’s
optimal length is the stability of the variables <span
class="citation">(Dormann and Griffin, 2015)</span>. Privacy concerns
and privacy attitudes are predominantly trait-like constructs with high
stabilities, which is why they necessitate longer intervals. Other
studies with comparable research questions have therefore used an
interval of 6 months <span class="citation">(e.g., Valkenburg and Peter,
2009)</span>, which we adopt also in this study.</p>
<p>In general, we believe that it should be possible to find long-term
effects. It has been argued that privacy concerns affect privacy
behavior in the long run <span class="citation">(e.g., Heirman et al.,
2013)</span>. The underlying theoretical mechanism could be that the
emotional part of privacy concerns causes (a) motivated information
selection and (b) motivated information processing, which is likely to
change actual behavior <span class="citation">(Nabi, 1999)</span>.
Specifically, when privacy concerns are higher than usual (e.g., because
of experienced or witnessed privacy infringements), people might begin
reading more media articles on privacy issues and might also consume
these articles more carefully, which could prompt information sharing
practices that are more cautious. Also empirically, a study with 290
participants found small negative longitudinal (between-person)
relations between privacy concerns and self-disclosure <span
class="citation">(Koohikamali et al., 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>At the same time, the adverse effect seems plausible as well, with
two potential outcomes. On the one hand, the long-term relation could be
positive: If people start to share more information online, they might
become increasingly aware that their privacy is at risk, thereby
stirring concern <span class="citation">(Tsay-Vogel et al.,
2018)</span>. On the other hand, the long-term relation might also be
negative: When people share more personal information online they might
become accustomed to doing so, which potentially reduces concern [for
example, due to the mere exposure effect; <span class="citation">Zajonc
(1968)</span>]. Finally, there could also be no long-term relation at
all: People might have already become used to sharing information
online, which stifles further cognitive or emotional processing. This
rationale is central to <em>privacy cynicism</em> <span
class="citation">(e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2016)</span>.</p>

<div id="the-role-of-attitudes" class="section level2">
<h2>The Role of Attitudes</h2>
<p>It has been argued that privacy attitudes could bridge the gap
between concerns and information sharing <span class="citation">(e.g.,
Dienlin and Trepte, 2015)</span>. In contrast to general and implicit
privacy concerns, privacy attitudes capture a more explicit, specific
cognitive appraisal <span class="citation">(Tsay-Vogel et al.,
2018)</span>. Because general dispositions oftentimes affect more
specific appraisals <span class="citation">(Fishbein and Ajzen,
2010)</span>, general concerns about privacy may similarly affect more
specific privacy attitudes <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Trepte,
2015)</span>. This reasoning follows the rational choice paradigm <span
class="citation">(Simon, 1955)</span>, which maintains that behavior is
always at least partially influenced by specific convictions, attitudes,
and cost-benefit analyses. Therefore, although both variables are
related to information disclosure, attitudes are likely the better
predictor. Also empirically, a study of 1,042 youths from Belgium found
that the relation between privacy attitudes and disclosure intentions of
personal information was strong (<em>r</em> = .56), whereas the relation
between privacy concerns and disclosure intentions was only moderate
[<em>r</em> = -.29; <span class="citation">Heirman et al.
(2013)</span>].</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3.1: People who are more concerned about their online
privacy than others will also hold a less positive attitude toward the
online sharing of personal information than others.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3.2: People with a more positive attitude toward the
online sharing of personal information than others will also share more
information online than others.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4.1: People who are more concerned about their online
privacy than they usually are will also hold a less positive attitude
toward the online sharing of personal information than they usually
do.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4.2: People with a more positive attitude toward the
online sharing of personal information than they usually have will also
share more information online than they usually do.</p>
<p>Concerning the potential long-term relations of privacy attitudes, we
are confronted with the same situation mentioned above. Because we are
not aware of research on long-term relations, several scenarios seem
plausible. Attitudes could either have long-term relations or not, and
information sharing could either foster privacy attitudes or diminish
them.</p>

<h1>Method</h1>
<div id="procedure-and-respondents" class="section level2">
<h2>Procedure and Respondents</h2>
<p>This study is part of a large-scale project which investigates the
development of privacy and self-disclosure, including several other
variables. Other publications linked to the project can be accessed at
<a href="https://osf.io/y35as/" class="uri">https://osf.io/y35as/</a>.
The data come from a longitudinal paper-and-pencil questionnaire study,
in which a representative sample of the German population (16 years and
older) was surveyed on overall five occasions. The data can be
downloaded from <a href="https://doi.org/10.7802/1937"
class="uri">https://doi.org/10.7802/1937</a>.</p>
<p>The first three waves were collected from May 2014 to May 2015, with
intervals of 6 months each. The last two waves were collected on May
2016 and May 2017, and had an interval of one year. Because we
hypothesized the effects to take place across half a year, the last two
waves were not included in the analyses presented here. First, a sample
of 14,714 potential respondents was drawn from a representative omnibus
survey in Germany (ADM master sample), using a random last-two-digit
dialing procedure. In this CATI screening, 5,286 respondents agreed to
participate in all following waves. Wave 1 was completed by 3,278
respondents (response rate: 38%), Wave 2 by 2,448 respondents (attrition
rate: 25%), and Wave 3 by 2,021 respondents (attrition rate: 17%). We
filtered respondents who never used the Internet at all waves, answered
fewer than 50% of the items in each scale for at least one wave,
provided inconsistent birth-dates across measurements, or did not report
sociodemographic variables. The final sample consisted of <em>n</em> =
1,403 respondents.</p>
<p>In the final sample, the rate of missing data was 5.4%. Visual
inspection of the missing value patterns as well as the non-parametric
test by <span class="citation">Jamshidian et al. (2014)</span> suggested
that all missing values could be considered missing at random
(<em>p</em> = .514). Therefore, Full Information Maximum Likelihood
estimation was conducted using all available data. The average age was
54 years (<em>SD</em> = 15 years), and 49% were male. About 39% reported
that they had graduated from college.</p>
</div>
<div id="measures" class="section level2">
<h2>Measures</h2>
<p>We tested the factorial validity of all measures using confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA). Each CFA included the items from all three waves.
For each item, factor loadings were constrained to be equal across
waves. Constrained and unconstrained models were compared using <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> differences tests. All results
were nonsignificant, suggesting longitudinal factorial invariance. The
measures showed good composite reliability in all three waves. Graphical
displays of the variables’ distributions showed that privacy concerns
were skewed to the left, privacy attitudes were normally distributed,
and information sharing was skewed to the right (Figure
@ref(fig:Distributions), diagonal). We calculated intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICCs) to quantify how much variance in the variables’
factor scores could be attributed to between-person differences. An
English translation of the original German items can be found in the
online supplementary material.</p>
<div id="concerns-about-online-privacy" class="section level3">
<h3>Concerns about online privacy</h3>
<p>Privacy concerns were measured as a second-order factor. Three
self-developed items captured the vertical dimension (e.g., “How
concerned are you that institutions or intelligence services collect and
analyze data that you disclosed on the Internet?”), and three items by
<span class="citation">Buchanan et al. (2007)</span> captured the
horizontal dimension (e.g., “How concerned are you that people that you
do not know might obtain information about you because of you online
activities?”). Respondents rated all items on a 5-point scale ranging
from 1 (<em>not at all concerned</em>) to 5 (<em>very concerned</em>).
The means were <em>M</em><sub>t1</sub> = 3.67, <em>M</em><sub>t2</sub> =
3.62, <em>M</em><sub>t3</sub> = 3.59, and the standard deviations
<em>SD</em><sub>t1</sub> = 0.88, <em>SD</em><sub>t2</sub> = 0.89, and
<em>SD</em><sub>t3</sub> = 0.90. The two-dimensional model fit the data
well, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>(118) = 661.17, &lt;
.001, cfi = .97, rmsea = .06, 90% CI [.05, .06], srmr = .04. The
reliability was high (<span

class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span><sub>t2</sub> = .96, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span><sub>t3</sub> = .97). Overall,
73.8534006% of the measure’s variance was explained by differences
between persons.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-online-sharing-of-personal-information"
class="section level3">
<h3>The online sharing of personal information</h3>
<p>To measure respondent’s level of information disclosure, they were
asked how often they disclosed 10 different pieces of information on the
Internet <span class="citation">(European Commission, 2011)</span>. The
exact question was: “How often do you disclose the following pieces of
information online (i.e., on the Internet)?” Each item was answered on a
5-point scale ranging from 1 (<em>never</em>) to 5 (<em>daily</em>).
Factor analyses suggested a second-order factor structure with five
first-order factors of two items each. The first first-order factor
subsumed financial and medical information, the second first and last
name, the third place of residence and street (including house number),
the fourth email address and phone number, and the fifth information
about education and current job. The means were <em>M</em><sub>t1</sub>
= 2.12, <em>M</em><sub>t2</sub> = 2.13, <em>M</em><sub>t3</sub> = 2.10,
and the standard deviations <em>SD</em><sub>t1</sub> = 0.66,
<em>SD</em><sub>t2</sub> = 0.64, and <em>SD</em><sub>t3</sub> = 0.61.
The model fit the data adequately, <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>(375) = 2527.69, &lt; .001, cfi =
.95, rmsea = .06, 90% CI [.06, .07], srmr = .06. The reliability was
high (<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span><sub>t1</sub> = .91,
<span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span><sub>t2</sub> = .92, <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span><sub>t3</sub> = .91). Overall,
64.2916969% of the measure’s variance was explained by differences
between persons.</p>

<div id="attitudes-toward-the-online-sharing-of-personal-information"
class="section level3">
<h3>Attitudes toward the online sharing of personal information</h3>
<p>Respondents’ attitudes toward disclosing personal information online
were captured with 10 items that measured the general appraisal of
disclosing the same 10 pieces of information <span
class="citation">(European Commission, 2011)</span>. Adhering to the
principle of compatibility <span class="citation">(Fishbein and Ajzen,
2010)</span>, the items were parallel to those of the actual disclosure
scale. Specifically, we asked: “Do you think that it is sensible to
disclose the following pieces of information online (i.e., on the
Internet)?” The scale ranged from 1 (<em>not at all sensible</em>) to 5
(<em>very sensible</em>). The means were <em>M</em><sub>t1</sub> = 3.67,
<em>M</em><sub>t2</sub> = 3.62, <em>M</em><sub>t3</sub> = 3.59, and the
standard deviations <em>SD</em><sub>t1</sub> = 0.88,

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>We follow the recommendation by <span class="citation">Lakens,
Adolfi, et al. (2018)</span> and first justify the choice of our alpha
level. We determined adequate error margins by considering the potential
implications of both false positive and false negative findings (i.e.,
alpha and beta errors): On the one hand, if we committed an alpha error,
we would wrongfully conclude that people’s concerns and behaviors are
consistent. Communicating such a false result to the public might
unjustly reassure people when they should be more alert. On the other
hand, if we committed a beta error, we would wrongfully conclude that
individuals behave paradoxically. Communicating such a false result
would unjustly accuse people of implausible behavior, potentially
causing unnecessary distress or reactance. We consider both errors to be
equally detrimental. Hence, we chose balanced error rates, setting a
maximum error rate of 5% for both alpha and beta. As the smallest effect
size of interest [SESOI; <span class="citation">Lakens, Scheel, et al.
(2018)</span>], we chose to consider effects that are at least small
[i.e., standardized coefficients above <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .10; <span class="citation">Cohen
(1992)</span>] as able to offer empirical support for our theoretical
hypotheses. Significantly smaller effects were not considered able to
offer support. The six hypotheses were tested with a one-tailed approach
and the six research questions with a two-tailed approach. On the basis
of the balanced alpha-beta approach with a maximum error probability of
5%, a desired power of 95%, and an SESOI of <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .10, we calculated a minimum
sample size of 1,293 respondents. Given the final sample size of 1,403
respondents, alpha and beta errors were balanced for our hypotheses
(research questions) when we used a critical alpha of 3% (4.2%),
resulting in a power of 97% (95.8%) to detect small effects.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The data were analyzed using of a random-intercept cross-lagged panel
model <span class="citation">(RI-CLPM, Hamaker et al., 2015)</span>. For
a visualization, see Figure @ref(fig:RICLPM). Note that in contrast to
regular cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs), RI-CLPMs can separate
between-person variance from within-person variance. We used factor
scores as observed variables to represent the variables’ latent
structure more closely. We tested H1, H3.1, and H3.2 by correlating the
random intercepts, which represent the respondents’ individual mean
scores across all three waves. We tested H2, H4.1, and H4.2 by
correlating the respondents’ within-person variance at T1, which
captures their specific deviation at T1 from their overall score. We
tested all research questions by regressing variables on all other
measures obtained 6 months earlier. Given that we had three points of
measurement, this resulted in two estimates for each research question.
As we did not assume longitudinal effects to differ across time, they
were constrained to be equal across all waves, which produces one single
general measure of each effect instead of two time-specific ones. (We
later tested this assumption empirically. As expected, the model with
constrained effects did not show significantly reduced model fit, <span
class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span><sup>2</sup>(9) = .114, <em>p</em> =
14.25, which supports that effects did not change over time.) Fit was
assessed according to the common criteria as described by <span
class="citation">Kline (2016)</span>. The final model fit the data well,
<span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>(15) = 25.18, = .048, cfi =

<p>Hypothesis 1 predicted that people reporting higher concerns about
online privacy than others would also be less likely to share personal
information online than others. Results revealed that the random
intercepts of the two variables were significantly correlated (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.09, = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.05,
-0.01], = -2.57, = .005). Hence, respondents who—on average across all
three waves—were more concerned about their privacy than others also
shared slightly less personal information online. The effect was small.
When looking at the standardized effect’s confidence interval (i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.09, 95% CI [-.15, -.02]),
it was not significantly smaller than our SESOI of <span
class="math inline">\(beta\)</span> = .10. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was
supported.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2 proposed that if people perceived more concerns about
their online privacy than they usually do, they would also share less
personal information online than they usually do. Results revealed a
small significant correlation (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.10, = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.03,
&gt; -0.01], = -2.37, = .009), suggesting that if respondents were more
concerned about their online privacy at T1 than usual, they also shared
less personal information online at T1 than usual. In conclusion, the
results supported Hypothesis 2.</p>
<p>With Research Question 1.1, we analyzed the longitudinal relation of
concerns about online privacy and the online sharing of personal
information 6 months later. No significant lagged effect across 6 months
was found (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .01, = 0.01, 95%
CI [-0.05, 0.07], = 0.41, = .683). With Research Question 1.2, we
investigated the longitudinal relation of the online sharing of personal
information and concerns about online privacy 6 months later, again
revealing no significant effect (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.03, = -0.03, 95% CI [-0.09,
0.04], = -0.80, = .422).</p>
<p>Hypothesis 3.1 predicted that people who perceived more privacy
concerns than others would also hold more negative attitudes toward the
online sharing of personal information than others. The results revealed
a medium-sized negative correlation between the two variables on the
between-person level (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.31,
= -0.11, 95% CI [-0.14, -0.08], = -8.46, &lt; .001). Thus, people who—on
average across all three waves—reported being more concerned about their
online privacy relative to the rest of the sample, were also
substantially more likely to hold a more negative attitude toward the
online sharing of personal information. The results therefore supported
Hypothesis 3.1. Hypothesis 3.2 stated that people who held more positive
attitudes toward the online sharing of personal information than others
would also share more personal information online than others. Results
showed a very strong between-person correlation between the two
variables (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .66, = 0.15, 95%
CI [0.13, 0.17], = 15.12, &lt; .001). In other words, when averaged
across all three waves, if people had more positive attitudes toward the
online sharing of personal information than others, they were much more
likely to actually share personal information online. In conclusion, the
results supported Hypothesis 3.2.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 4.1 proposed that people who perceived more privacy
concerns than usual would also hold more negative attitudes toward the
online sharing of personal information than usual. The results did not
reveal a significant effect (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>
= -.06, = -0.01, 95% CI [-0.03, &lt; 0.01], = -1.38, = .084). Hypothesis
4.2 proposed that people who held more positive attitudes toward the
online sharing of personal information than usual would also share more
personal information online than usual. Results showed a moderate
within-person correlation between the two variables (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .15, = 0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.05],
= 4.01, &lt; .001), which indicates that when respondents had more
positive attitudes at T1 than usual, they also shared more personal
information than usual. In conclusion, the results supported Hypothesis
4.2.</p>
<p>With Research Question 2.1, we analyzed the longitudinal relations of
concerns about online privacy and positive attitudes toward the online
sharing of personal information. No significant effect was found (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.02, = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.09,
0.06], = -0.47, = .641). Regarding Research Question 2.2, again no
significant longitudinal relations emerged between privacy attitudes and
privacy concerns 6 months later (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &lt; .01, &lt; 0.01, 95% CI [-0.06,
0.06], = 0.06, = .951).</p>
<p>Research Question 3.1 asked whether changes in attitudes toward the
online sharing of personal information would affect changes in personal
information sharing 6 months later. No significant effect was found
(<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &gt; -.01, &gt; -0.01, 95%
CI [-0.06, 0.05], = -0.07, = .947). Next, Research Question 3.2 asked
whether changes in the online sharing of personal information would
affect attitudes toward the online sharing of personal information 6
months later. Again, no significant effect was found (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .04, = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.03,
0.11], = 1.15, = .249).</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> The between-person correlations represent
interpersonal relations. For example, results showed that people who
were more concerned than others, averaged across all three waves, also
shared less information than others. The within-person parameters
reflect how intrapersonal changes in one variable are related to
intra-personal changes in another. For example, results showed that if a
person was more concerned at T1 than usual, they also shared less
information than usual.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>In an additional analysis, we also tested the same model with a 1
year interval, which allowed to include data spanning until winter 2016
and 2017. Most effects remained the same. For example, we again found
that people more concerned than others were less positive regarding
information sharing (<em>r</em> = -.36, <em>p</em> &lt; .001 ) and
shared less information (<em>r</em> = -.15, <em>p</em> = .002).
Likewise, people more positive toward data sharing than others also
shared substantially more data (<em>r</em> = .66, <em>p</em> &lt; .001).
Because including these two additional waves significantly reduces
sample size, and because we consider it more likely that effects take
place more immediately, these results should be considered exploratory.
For an overview of the results, see the additional analyses on our
companion website (Section 2.1.2.7).</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Most research on the privacy paradox suggests a significant small
effect of privacy concerns on the online sharing of personal information
<span class="citation">(e.g., Baruh et al., 2017)</span>. However,
whereas the theoretical premise of the privacy paradox addresses a
within-person <em>effect</em>, most empirical studies have analyzed only
between-person <em>relations</em>. On the basis of a representative
sample of the German population, from which three waves of data
separated by 6 months were collected, we hence analyzed the privacy
paradox by differentiating general between-person relations, short-term
within-person relations, as well as long-term within-person effects.
Together, this approach allows for informed inferences about the
variables’ causal relationship.</p>
<p>The results of the between-person analyses showed that people who
were more concerned about their privacy than others were slightly less
likely to share personal information. In addition, people who were more
concerned about their privacy than others also held substantially more
negative attitudes toward disclosing personal information online.
Notably, we found a very strong between-person correlation between
attitudes toward information sharing and actual information sharing,
which shows that typical online disclosure can be predicted precisely by
a person’s attitude. Taken together, the cross-sectional results are in
line with the extant literature: The between-person correlation of
privacy concerns and information sharing found in this study (i.e.,
<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.09) fall within the 95%
confidence interval of the effect reported by <span
class="citation">Baruh et al. (2017)</span> (i.e., <em>r</em> = -.13,
95% CI [-.07, -.18]). Notably, the between-person correlations reported
here represent averaged measurements across three waves, which makes the
findings more robust than typical one-shot measures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study suggests that the privacy paradox does not
exist on a between-person level. The differences between people with
regard to their online information sharing behavior can be explained by
differences in their privacy concerns to a small extent, and by
differences in their privacy attitudes to a large extent. The more
specific we become, the better we can explain online behavior: Whereas
privacy concerns are related only weakly to online information sharing
<span class="citation">(e.g., Baruh et al., 2017)</span>, more specific
risks perceptions are related to behavior more closely <span
class="citation">(e.g., Bol et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2020)</span>,
whereas behavioral attitudes are the best predictors <span
class="citation">(Dienlin and Trepte, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>The within-person results showed that when a person’s privacy
concerns are higher than usual, the same person also shared slightly
less information online than usual. Moreover, people who developed more
positive attitudes toward the online sharing of personal information
than usual, also shared substantially more personal information online.
Together, changes in concerns and attitudes are therefore related to
changes in behavior, which speaks against the privacy paradox also on
the within-person level.</p>
<p>We did not find any long-term effects, however. Changes in both
privacy concerns and attitudes toward the online sharing of personal
information were not related to any meaningful changes in the online
sharing of personal information 6 months later (and vice versa). As an
explanation, it might be the case that changes in privacy concern affect
information sharing more immediately. To test this assumption, we would
need studies with shorter intervals <span class="citation">(Keijsers,
2016)</span>. Moreover, given that the directions of most longitudinal
relations were in line with the between-person and within-person
relations, longitudinal effects might indeed take place, but only that
they are very small. Of course, it could also be that longterm
longitudinal effects do not exist.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The data were collected between May 2014 and May 2015—hence, after
the Snowden revelations in 2013, but before the Equifax data breach in
2017, the Cambridge Analytica data breach in 2018, or the implementation
of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018. Such sweeping events,
however, could affect privacy concerns, online behavior, or their mutual
relation, which would limit the generalizability of our results.
Although this is an important caveat, we have reason to believe that our
findings are largely robust. First, additional analyses showed that the
within-person relationships were stable across waves (a period of 1
year). Second, another set of additional analyses showed that most
effects remained stable until winter 2017. Third, records of online
search terms revealed that although interest in privacy-related topics
and privacy-enhancing technologies increased after the Snowden
revelations, it returned to prior levels after only two weeks <span
class="citation">(Preibusch, 2015)</span>. It thus seems that levels of
privacy concerns and information sharing, as well as their mutual
relationship, are largely robust.</p>
<p>In asking how much information respondents share when using the
Internet in general, we automatically aggregated different platforms,
contexts, and situations. However, privacy mechanisms can differ largely
across contexts <span class="citation">(Nissenbaum, 2010)</span> and
situations <span class="citation">(Masur, 2018)</span>. Our broad
perspective, therefore, is somewhat problematic and limits our capacity
to understand and predict the behavior of individual people in specific
situations. At the same time, aiming to maximize generalizability, we
were able to extract some general underlying patterns, which can serve
as a starting point for more contextualized analyses (see below).</p>
<p>Some of the effect sizes reported in this study are potentially not
large enough to refute the privacy paradox completely. On the one hand,
they could be a manifestation of the so-called “crud factor” <span
class="citation">(Meehl, 1990: 204)</span>, which states that all
psychosocial measures are related to one another to some extent. On the
other hand, additional factors such as expected benefits might play a
more important role <span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger,
2016)</span>. In conclusion, although our results suggest that privacy
concerns and privacy attitudes are correlated with information sharing,
the importance of privacy concerns should not be exaggerated. The
effects could be larger, and other variables play a role as well.</p>
<p>In this study we measured information sharing using self-reports.
However, self-reports of frequent and routine behaviors are often
imprecise and unreliable <span class="citation">(Scharkow, 2016)</span>.
This represents a profound limitation of our study; whenever possible,
future studies should aim to collect objective observations of specific
types of behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, please note that the hypotheses presented in this study were
not formally preregistered. At the time when the study was conceived in
2014, we were not yet aware of the importance of preregistration.</p>
</div>
<div id="future-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Future Research</h2>
<p>We emphasize that when analyzing the privacy paradox we are likely
dealing with small effects <span class="citation">(Baruh et al.,
2017)</span>. Hence, to detect these small effects reliably we need
large samples. This is often not the case <span class="citation">(Baruh
et al., 2017)</span>. In conclusion, it is crucial to use statistical
designs that allow for sufficient statistical power.</p>
<p>Next, evidence of within-person longitudinal effects is still
missing. Although we found significant within-person correlations at T1,
they were absent across the 6-month intervals. Together, this suggests
that longitudinal effects might exist, but that they take place on a
different time interval. Future research could hence probe different
intervals. For theoretical reasons (e.g., due to availability
heuristics), it is plausible to use short intervals; for statistical
reasons (e.g., because of the high stability of privacy concerns), it
would also make sense to test longer intervals <span
class="citation">(Dormann and Griffin, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, we emphasize that our findings should not be
overgeneralized. They are conditional on the data we collected, the
methods we applied, and the theoretical perspectives we adopted. We
stress that analyzing the privacy paradox in other contexts using
alternative approaches will likely lead to different results. Although
we argue that in most circumstances privacy concerns and behavior should
correlate modestly, the exact extent depends on a many boundary
conditions. Future research should hence explicitly analyze different
contexts <span class="citation">(Nissenbaum, 2010)</span> and situations
<span class="citation">(Masur, 2018)</span>. Building on <span
class="citation">Kokolakis (2017)</span>, we suggest to analyze the
following boundary conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>context (e.g., professional, social, commercial, or
health-related);</li>
<li>situation (e.g., new, habitualized, or unexpected);</li>
<li>mood (e.g., positive vs. negative);</li>
<li>extent of control (high vs. low);</li>
<li>type of information processing applied (implicit, heuristic, or
peripheral vs. explicit, analytic, or central);</li>
<li>existence of bias (e.g., overconfidence, optimism, comparative
optimism, or hyperbolic discounting);</li>
<li>type of information (e.g., sensitive vs. superficial, biographic, or
person-related);</li>
<li>benefit immediacy and risk diffusion (high vs. low);</li>
<li>object of investigation (e.g., individual people, interactions
between people, developmental perspectives, critical incidents, societal
structures, or historical developments).</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, we encourage analyzing privacy behaviors also from a
situational perspective, accounting for temporal needs, interpersonal
perceptions, contextual cues, or characteristics of communication
channels <span class="citation">(Masur, 2018)</span>. For example,
whereas general levels of information sharing are likely best explained
using privacy <em>concerns</em>, situational information sharing might
be best explained using privacy <em>heuristics</em> <span
class="citation">(Sundar et al., 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>Next to these theory-related boundary conditions there are also
methodological ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>analysis design and perspective (e.g., theoretical, experimental,
questionnaire-based, interview-based, ethnographic, or
computational);</li>
<li>quality of measurement (high vs. low; low quality less likely to
detect statistical significance);</li>
<li>sample size (small vs. large; small samples less likely to detect
statistical significance);</li>
<li>statistical analysis (e.g., SEM vs. Regression; analyses without
error control less likely to find statistical significance);</li>
<li>operationalization (e.g., concerns vs. risk perceptions
vs. behavioral attitudes; the more specific, the stronger the
relation).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Being able to show that online behaviors are not paradoxical can be
socially relevant. Consider the similar case of fear appeals and
protective behavior, where there is also only a small correlation <span
class="citation">(Witte and Allen, 2000)</span>. However, fear appeals
are used in public campaigns nonetheless, oftentimes to much success
<span class="citation">(Wakefield et al., 2010)</span>. Likewise,
proclaiming that the online sharing of personal information is not
paradoxical and that concerns about online privacy matter, could lead to
more cautious and reflective behavior. It is probably no coincidence
that the General Data Protection Regulation, which strengthens the
privacy rights of consumers, was passed in Europe, where privacy
concerns are particularly pronounced <span class="citation">(European
Commission, 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>In sum, this study showed that when people were more concerned about
their privacy, they also shared a little less personal information about
themselves online. If respondents considered sharing personal
information to be insensible, they disclosed substantially less
information. Together, these findings do not support the existence of a
privacy paradox, at least in this particular context and
operationalization. No evidence of long-term effects was found, however.
Further research is needed to understand the potential causal interplay
of concerns, attitudes, and behavior.</p>
