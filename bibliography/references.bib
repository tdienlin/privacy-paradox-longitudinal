  abstract = {This Review summarizes and draws connections between diverse streams of empirical research on privacy behavior. We use three themes to connect insights from social and behavioral sciences: people's uncertainty about the consequences of privacy-related behaviors and their own preferences over those consequences; the context-dependence of people's concern, or lack thereof, about privacy; and the degree to which privacy concerns are malleable-manipulable by commercial and governmental interests. Organizing our discussion by these themes, we offer observations concerning the role of public policy in the protection of privacy in the information age.},

Which values relate more strongly to behavior than others? Do relations among different values and behaviors exhibit a meaningful overall structure? If so, how to explain this? We find that stimulation and tradition values relate strongly to the behaviors that express them; hedonism, power, universalism, and self-direction values relate moderately; and security, conformity, achievement, and benevolence values relate only marginally. Additional findings suggest that these differences in value-behavior relations may stem from normative pressures to perform certain behaviors. Such findings imply that values motivate behavior, but the relation between values and behaviors is partly obscured by norms. Relations among behaviors, among values, and jointly among values and behavior exhibit a similar structure. The motivational conflicts and congruities postulated by the theory of values can account for this shared structure.},

In particular, cross-lagged regression coefficients may vary, depending on the respective time lags between different sets of measurement occasions. This article introduces the concept of an optimal time lag. Further, it is demonstrated that optimal time lags in panel studies are related to the stabilities of the variables investigated, and that in unidirectional systems, they may be unrelated to the size of possible true effects. The results presented also suggest that optimal time lags for panel designs are usually quite short. Implications are (a) that interpreting cross-lagged regression coefficients requires taking the time lag between measurement occasions into account, and (b) that in much research, far shorter time lags than those frequently found in the literature are justifiable, and we call for more "shortitudinal" studies in the future.},

However, recent research on this issue has been all but conclusive. METHOD: We present a three-level, random effects meta-analysis including 289 effect sizes from 57 studies (total N = 25,631) on the association between trait narcissism and social networking behavior. RESULTS: The meta-analysis identified a small to moderate effect of rho = .17 (tau = .11), 95\% CI [.13, .21], for grandiose narcissism that replicated across different social networking platforms, respondent characteristics, and time. Moderator analyses revealed pronounced cultural differences, with stronger associations in power-distant cultures. Moreover, social networking behaviors geared toward self-presentation and the number of SNS friends exhibited stronger effects than usage durations. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study not only supported but also refined the notion of a relationship between engaging in social networking sites and narcissistic personality traits.},

  abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

Health beliefs are modeled as an interaction between concern with health and health locus of control, since we expect that concern with health has the largest impact on eating habits for persons who believe they have some control over their health. This interaction term is significant. For the average person, appearance is as large a motivating factor in eating habits as is concern with health.

This study adopts a global theoretical framework to predict adolescents’ disclosure of personal information in 
exchange for incentives offered by commercial Websites. The study postulates and tests the validity of a model 
based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), including antecedent factors of attitude and perceived behavioral 
control (PBC). A survey was conducted among 1,042 respondents. Results from SEM analyses show that the 
hypothesized model fits the empirical data well. The model accounts for 61.9 percent of the variance in adolescents’ 
intention to disclose and 43.7 percent of the variance in self-reported disclosure. Perceived social 
pressure exerted by significant others (subjective norm) is the most important TPB factor in predicting intention 
to disclose personal information in exchange for incentives. This finding suggests that in discussions of adolescents’ 
information privacy, the importance of social factors outweighs the individually oriented TPB factors of 
attitude and PBC. Moreover, privacy concern and trust propensity are significant predictors of respondents’ 
attitudes toward online disclosure in exchange for commercial incentives, whereas the frequency of Internet use 
significantly affects their level of PBC.},

Integrating focus group results into a theoretical privacy calculus framework, we develop and empirically test a Structural Equation Model of self-disclosure with 259 subjects. We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users’ perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options. Based on these findings, we offer recommendations for network providers.},

  abstract = {The effects of acute exercise on cognitive performance were examined using meta-analytic techniques. The overall mean effect size was dependent on the timing of cognitive assessment. During exercise, cognitive task performance was impaired by a mean effect of -0.14. However, impairments were only observed during the first 20min of exercise. Otherwise, exercise-induced arousal enhanced performance on tasks that involved rapid decisions and automatized behaviors. Following exercise, cognitive task performance improved by a mean effect of 0.20. Arousal continued to facilitate speeded mental processes and also enhanced memory storage and retrieval. Positive effects were observed following exercise regardless of whether the study protocol was designed to measure the effects of steady-state exercise, fatiguing exercise, or the inverted-U hypothesis. Finally, cognitive performance was affected differentially by exercise mode. Cycling was associated with enhanced performance during and after exercise, whereas treadmill running led to impaired performance during exercise and a small improvement in performance following exercise. These results are indicative of the complex relation between exercise and cognition. Cognitive performance may be enhanced or impaired depending on when it is measured, the type of cognitive task selected, and the type of exercise performed.},

Using prospect theory to examine willingness to disclose in an online service context, the authors propose and find that greater sensitivity of information requested produces weaker effects of customization benefits but stronger effects of information control and online privacy concern. The authors also find that customization benefits can overcome the negative effects of sensitive information requests when concern is lower or control is higher, and that perceived risk and firm trust are mechanisms through which disclosure antecedents operate. For theory, this research suggests that online disclosure models need to include sensitivity of information as a moderator. Moreover, the privacy paradox (consumers voice concerns but still disclose) may result from a failure to account for information sensitivity, since the authors find no effect of privacy concern on overall disclosure but find the predicted negative effect for higher sensitive information. For practice, our research suggests actionable strategies to aid online marketers in matching information requests with the needs and concerns of consumers by providing greater control and customization, enhancing firm trust, and adapting information requests to the situation.},

Although the causes and solutions are varied, we focus here on a common logical problem in inference. The default mode of inference is significance testing, which has a free lunch property where researchers need not make detailed assumptions about the alternative to test the null hypothesis. We present the argument that there is no free lunch; that is, valid testing requires that researchers test the null against a well-specified alternative. We show how this requirement follows from the basic tenets of conventional and Bayesian probability. Moreover, we show in both the conventional and Bayesian framework that not specifying the alternative may lead to rejections of the null hypothesis with scant evidence. We review both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to specifying alternatives, and we show how such specifications improve inference. The field of cognitive science will benefit because consideration of reasonable alternatives will undoubtedly sharpen the intellectual underpinnings of research.},

Following Goffman on self-presentation and Altman’s theorizing of privacy as an optimization between competing pressures for disclosure and withdrawal, the author investigates the mechanisms used by a sample (n = 704) of college students, the vast majority users of Facebook and Myspace, to negotiate boundaries between public and private. Findings show little to no relationship between online privacy concerns and information disclosure on online social network sites. Students manage unwanted audience concerns by adjusting profile visibility and using nicknames but not by restricting the information within the profile. Mechanisms analogous to boundary regulation in physical space, such as walls, locks, and doors, are favored; little adaptation is made to the Internet’s key features of persistence, searchability, and cross-indexability. The author also finds significant racial and gender differences.},

this study, an online survey was conducted among a sample of 1484 SNS users ranging in age from 10 to 65 years. In 
addition to gender and age, we investigated the following predictors: frequency of and motives for SNS use, trust in other 
users, peer influence and concerns related to privacy and contact risks. The results show that adolescents disclose more 
personal data and apply more lenient privacy settings to these data than adults do. Several factors were found to affect 
disclosure and profile-access management, with differences between adolescents and adults in some cases. Finally, we 
discuss implications emerging from the study’s findings.},

  abstract = {With The Privacy Longitudinal Study, we surveyed and investigated privacy attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors in the German population. In our longitudinal study a representative panel of participants was surveyed five times over the course of three years between 2014 and 2017. 

The aim of this survey is to help generate profound knowledge about the German population's attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions surrounding privacy. We are grateful that we were able to follow up on this aim with the support of the German Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF) and with the support of the “Forum Privatheit” (www.forumprivatheit.de) – an interdisciplinary research consortium that has been collaborating since 2012 on questions of informational self-determination and privacy. 

At the core of the survey, we measured people’s behavior in different mediated and non-mediated communication settings. We believe that in Germany and around the globe, the term privacy is now mostly connected to the online world. However, online privacy has to be managed also through offline communication. Moreover, privacy in offline settings is also affected by our online communication. In our survey, we asked respondents to report their perceptions, behaviors, and beliefs regarding typical communication situations that they might encounter in all kinds of social media and – of course – in face-to-face communication.

  abstract = {Even though users have become increasingly concerned about their privacy online, they continue to disclose deeply personal information in a number of online venues, including e-commerce portals and social networking sites. Scholars have tried to explain this inconsistency between attitudes and behavior by suggesting that online users consciously weigh the trade-off between the costs and benefits of online information disclosure. We argue that online user behaviors are not always rational, but may occur due to expedient decision-making in the heat of the moment. Such decisions are based on cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) rather than on a careful analysis of each transaction. Based on this premise, we seek to identify the specific triggers for disclosure of private information online. In the experiment reported here, we explore the operation of two specific heuristics—benefit and fuzzy boundary—in influencing privacy-related attitudes and behaviors. Theoretical and design implications are discussed.},
