In what follows, we report the models that were run to obtain the results reported in the manuscript. To see the underlying code, click on the button `code`.

# Sociodemographics

```{r}
n_complete <- nrow(d_wide)
age_m <- mean(d_wide$age)
age_sd <- sd(d_wide$age)
male_per <- 1 - mean(d_wide$male)
edu_col_per <- nrow(d_wide[d_wide$edu_num > 5, ]) / n_complete * 100
tibble(
  "N" = n_complete,
  "Age" = age_m,
  "Age SD" = age_sd,
  "Male perc." = male_per,
  "College perc." = edu_col_per
  ) %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling("striped")
```

# Analysis of Missing Values

```{r cache=F}
d_tmp <- select(d_wide, -contains("_m"), -contains("tim"), -contains("T4"), -contains("T5"), -contains("per"), -contains("use"), -c(id, age, edu, edu_num, male))
test_mar <- TestMCARNormality(d_tmp)

# print patterns
as.data.frame(test_mar$patused)

# non-parametric test
(test_mar_p <- test_mar$pnormality)

# calculate percentage of missing data
na_per <- mean(c(d_wide$t1_na_per, d_wide$t2_na_per, d_wide$t3_na_per)) * 100
```

Visual inspection of the missing value patterns as well as the non-parametric test suggested that all missing values could be considered to be missing at random (_p_ `r test_mar$pnormality %>% td::my_round("p_txt")`).

# Measures

In what follows, we report the measures we collected, including their items, factorial validity, reliability, and ICC. For the measures' longitudinal invariance, see [additional analyses](analyses_additional.Rmd).

## Concerns about online privacy
### Items

The following deals with things that can happen on the Internet.

1. In general, how concerned are you about your privacy while using the Internet?
2. Are you concerned about online organizations not being who they claim they are?
3. Are you concerned about online identity theft?
4. Are you concerned about people you do not know obtaining personal information about you from your online activities?
5. Are you concerned that if you use your credit card to buy something on the Internet your credit card number will be obtained/intercepted by someone else?
6. Are you concerned that an email you sent may be read by someone else besides the person you sent it to?
7. Are you concerned that institutions or secret services could collect and analyze the data that you are disclosing on the Internet?
8. Are you concerned that website providers are tracking your online activities?
9. Are you concerned that you don’t know what other organizations or website providers are doing with you data?

## Attitude Toward Online Sharing of Personal Information
### Items

Now we will deal with information sharing on the Internet. Do you think that it is sensible to disclose the following pieces of information online, i.e., via the Internet?

1. Financial information (bank data, account balances…)
2. Medical information (health, medical records…)
3. Second name
4. First name
5. Residence
6. Street and house number
7. Email address
8. Phone number
9. Photos (of you)
10. Job (past and present)
11. Education

# Power Analyses

```{r power}
alpha <- .05
power <- .95
sesoi <- .1
n <- n_complete
n_apriori <- pwr.r.test(r = sesoi, sig.level = alpha, power = power)$n
power_achieved_h <- pwr.r.test(r = sesoi, sig.level = alpha, n = n, alternative = "greater")$power
alpha_balanced_h <- balance_errors(sesoi, n, one_tailed = TRUE)
power_balanced_h <- 1 - alpha_balanced_h
power_achieved_rq <- pwr.r.test(r = sesoi, sig.level = alpha, n = n)$power
alpha_balanced_rq <- balance_errors(sesoi, n, one_tailed = FALSE)
power_balanced_rq <- 1 - alpha_balanced_rq
```

A-priori power analyses revealed that N = `r n_apriori` people would be needed to find effects with a size of _r_ = `r sesoi` with a power of `r power`.

Overall, the data of `r n` respondents could be used for our analyses. As a result, alpha and beta errors were balanced when using an alpha of `r alpha_balanced_h %>% round(3)`, resulting in an achieved power of `r power_balanced_h %>% round(3)`.

# Results

In what follows, please find all information about our final model we present in the paper.

## Correlation matrix and distributions

```{r Corrplot, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, size=5}
colnames(d_fs) <- c("Privacy\nconcerns\nT1", "Privacy\nconcerns\nT2" , "Privacy\nconcerns\nT3",
                    "Positive\nattitude\nT1", "Positive\nattitude\nT2" , "Positive\nattitude\nT3",
                    "Information\nsharing\nT1", "Information\nsharing\nT2" , "Information\nsharing\nT3")

corr_plot <- ggpairs(d_fs,
                     lower = list(continuous = wrap(td::scat_plot, coords = c(1, 5, 1, 5)))) + 
  theme_bw()
print(corr_plot)
```

## Visualization of Model

```{r, fig.cap="Visual representation of the estimated random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/model_7.png")
```

## Assumptions

We first test the assumption of multivariate normal distribution.

```{r multivardis}
mult_norm_test <- mvn(d_fs)
print(mult_norm_test)
```

Results show that the assumption of multivariate normal distribution was violated. Hence, it'd be preferable to conduct robust Maximum Likelihood Estimation. However, using robust estimation it is not possible to run SEM on all data using Full Information Maximum Likehoood (FIML). Given that we consider it more important to include as much information as possible and that estimators often produce similar results, we decided to estimate the following models using regular maximum likehood.
